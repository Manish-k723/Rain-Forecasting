# Rain Forecasting
Welcome to the Rain Forecasting Project repository! This project aims to use machine learning techniques to predict the rain based on historical data.

Project Overview
The project includes data collection, preprocessing, and feature engineering to create a dataset suitable for training a machine learning model. It also includes the implementation of multiple algorithms to predict the weather such as linear regression,Decision Tree, Random Forest and GRU. The models are evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and r-squared values. The best performing model is then used to make predictions on new data.
